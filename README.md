# Flutter login system

This is a simple Flutter login system where users can log in only if the username and password are the same. It demonstrates basic authentication logic using TextFields, form validation, and user input handling in Flutter.

## How It Works

User Input: The user enters a username and password.

Validation: If both values are identical, the user is logged in.
